## Description
This is application contains 12 questions to test the knowledge of JavaScript beginners. The questions are set such that there are multiple choices for the user to select from, once the user is satisfied on all the answers he/she has chosen then there is a submit button where the user will be able to click and submit his/her answers. The app is real-time as it quickly calculates the users performance based on the correct answers and returns a score. If the user fails to answer a question he will receive a Nan answer, meaning there will be no grade despite attempting some of the quizes, therefore the user must attempt all questions for him/her to get a score.
